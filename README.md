"" Notes
- [08-14-24] Currently refactoring the source after being away for 3 months. While trying to figure out how to decouple the css
for a web-component into a separate file, I've concluded that it would be challenging if not actually impossible without a build tool such
as vite. I've been avoiding this type of complexity along with frameworks to better learn more essential programming but I think now
there's no avoiding it. Such is the life, eh
